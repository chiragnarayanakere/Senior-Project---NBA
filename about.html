            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>The goal of this project is to predict future NBA prospects and how well they will perform 4 years after they are drafted. 
                This is important because NBA teams spend a lot time time, money, and resources on drafting prospects and want them to contribute
                to the team's success. Because the stakes are high, teams want to minimize drafting busts. Using statistics, machine learning, 
                this tool will enable teams to pick the best players for their future. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To gather all the necessary information needed, we used Python to write a webscraping program that would allow us to obtain
                players' statistics. We then stored all of those stats into a database using MySQL to easily access them. Once those stats were
                organized, we converted them to a CSV file which was then fed into Weka. Weka gave us the stats that best corresponded with the 
                rankings we're trying to predict. We then use those attributes and once again used Python to give us a predictive model.

            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                We are Computer Science/Software Engineering seniors from Cal Poly interested in the NBA and wanted to do a meaningful project 
                related it to it. We wanted to use this project as a way to showcase the skills we have developed over the past 4 years, as well
                as take this oppurtunity to learn and explore subjects of our own interests.
